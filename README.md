## Description

The **d3d4linux** project allows to compile HLSL shaders on Linux using
the Microsoft DirectX compiler DLL. It works by launching a Windows
program in the background using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and
diverting calls to that server on the fly.

**Note: this is not for porting games to Linux. The goal of this project
is to use Linux machines to build and package Windows games (because
Linux build machines are cheaper and more reliable). You could see it as
“shader cross-compilation”. In the end you still get HLSL bytecode which
is of little use on Linux.**

Only four functions are implemented for now. They are the ones
required by the Unreal Engine shader compiler:

  * `D3DCompile`
  * `D3DReflect`
  * `D3DStripShader`
  * `D3DDisassemble`

**d3d4linux** is **work in progress** and **not ready for production**
but is being successfully used at [Dontnod Entertainment](http://dont-nod.com/)
to package Windows versions of Unreal Engine 4 games.

## Build

Prerequisites:

    apt install g++-mingw-w64

Build d3d4linux:

    make

## Test

Prerequisites:

    apt install wine64

Launch the test:

    make check

## Unreal Engine integration

Patch and build:

  * copy `d3d4linux.Build.cs` and the `include` directory to `Engine/Sources/ThirdParty/d3d4linux`.
  * copy `d3d4linux.exe` and `d3dcompiler_43.dll` to `Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/d3d4linux`.
  * apply the patch found in `extras/patch-ue4.11-support.diff` to the Unreal source tree.
  * verify and optionally tweak the `D3D4LINUX_` macros in
    `Engine/Source/Developer/Windows/ShaderFormatD3D/Private/D3D11ShaderCompiler.cpp`
    so that they match your desired setup (note that these can also be overridden at
    runtime using the similarly named environment variables)
  * make sure to rebuild `UE4Editor` and `ShaderCompileWorker`.

Run:

  * with AutomationTool: run `BuildCookRun` as usual with the `-targetplatform=Win64` argument.
  * with UE4Editor: run with the `-run=Cook -TargetPlatform=WindowsNoEditor` arguments.

Debug:

  * set the `D3D4LINUX_VERBOSE` environment variable to `1` for some debugging information.
